Frequently Asked Question:

1. Why do I get kicked for, game not supported?
A: The game was not found in a table, specifically made to detect if you're in the right game.

2. Why does some of the features doesn't work?
A: The script may be out-dated.

3. Why do you need a key?
The reason I add a key; is because, I want to grow a active community. By doing so I get members checking the server; joining the server everytime the key changes.
